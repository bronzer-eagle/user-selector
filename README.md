#User select app
Some test app using react and react hooks

##Installation
I've used `yarn` and all cli commands use `yarn`.
**So make sure you have installed `yarn` on your computer**

* `yarn install` or simply `yarn`
* `yarn start` - it will build an app and will start server
* go to `localhost:3000` in your browser
